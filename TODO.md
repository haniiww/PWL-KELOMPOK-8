# TODO List for Proof Page Implementation

- [x] Create proof.php file based on Payment-Method.php
- [x] Modify proof.php to keep ticket details in middle section and replace payment method in right section with QR code
- [x] Update the progress bar in proof.php to mark "Proof" as active
- [x] Edit Payment-Method.js to navigate to proof.php when proceeding with payment
- [ ] Test navigation from payment method page to proof page (PHP server started, browser testing disabled)
- [x] Ensure QR code displays correctly (using Google Charts API) - Randomized square size (150-250px)
